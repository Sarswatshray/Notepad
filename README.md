# Notepad
In this Repository I have made a Notepad in Python in Tkinter Module. I am a Student, I read in class 8th now. 
You can use it to as your default notepad as it have all the features that are in the built-in Notepad in Windows.
But, to run this notepad you have to install python and the Tkinter module in Python.
